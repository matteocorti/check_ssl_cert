check_ssl_cert

A Nagios plugin to check an X.509 certificate:
 - checks if the server is running and delivers a valid certificate
 - checks if the CA matches a given pattern
 - checks the validity

Usage:
======

check_ssl_cert -H host [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
   -H,--host host         server

Options:
   -A,--noauth            ignore authority warnings (expiration only)
   -C,--clientcert path   use client certificate to authenticate
      --clientpass phrase set passphrase for client certificate.
   -c,--critical days     minimum number of days a certificate has to be valid
                          to issue a critical status
   -e,--email address     pattern to match the email address contained in the
                          certificate
   -f,--file file         local file path (works with -H localhost only)
   -h,--help,-?           this help message
   -i,--issuer issuer     pattern to match the issuer of the certificate
   -n,---cn name          pattern to match the CN of the certificate
   -N,--host-cn           match CN with the host name
      --ocsp              check revocation via OCSP
   -o,--org org           pattern to match the organization of the certificate
      --openssl path      path of the openssl binary to be used
   -p,--port port         TCP port
   -P,--protocol protocol use the specific protocol {http|smtp|pop3|imap|ftp}
                          http:               default
                          smtp,pop3,imap,ftp: switch to TLS
   -s,--selfsigned        allows self-signed certificates
   -r,--rootcert path     root certificate or directory to be used for
                          certficate validation
   -t,--timeout           seconds timeout after the specified time
                          (defaults to 15 seconds)
      --temp dir          directory where to store the temporary files
   -v,--verbose           verbose output
   -V,--version           version
   -w,--warning days      minimum number of days a certificate has to be valid
                          to issue a warning status

Deprecated options:
   -d,--days days         minimum number of days a certificate has to be valid
                          (see --critical and --warning)

Expect:
=======

check_ssl_cert requires 'expect' to enable timouts. If expect is not
present on your system timeouts will be disabled.

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect

Perl and Date::Parse:
=====================

If perl and Date::Parse are available the plugin will also compute for
how many days the certificate will be valid and put the information in
the performance data. If perl or Date::Parse are not available the
information will not be available.

Virtual servers:
================

check_ssl_client supports the servername TLS extension in ClientHello
if the installed openssl version provides it. This is needed if you
are checking a machine with virtual hosts.

Notes:
======

the root certificate corresponding to the checked certificate must be
available to openssl or specified with the '-r cabundle' or
'--rootcert cabundle' option, where cabundle is either a file for -CAfile
or a directory for -CApath.

On Mac OS X the root certificates bundle is stored in the Keychain and
openssl will complain with:

   verification error: unable to get local issuer certificate

The bundle can be extracted with:

$ sudo security find-certificate -a \
  -p /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain > cabundle.crt
